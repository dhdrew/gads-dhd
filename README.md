## Overview
This repository contains the work for my final project at General Assembly New York's Data Science course, taken from April to June 2016. As of May 23, the primary focus of the final project is testing the validity of different risk assessment methods in the criminal justice system. I plan to build this repository out over time to contain further work and research on the intersection of criminal justice reform and data science.
