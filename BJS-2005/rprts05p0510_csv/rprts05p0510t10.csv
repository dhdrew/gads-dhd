"Note: Prisoners were tracked for 5 years following release. Inmates could have been in prison for more than one offense; the most serious one is reported in this table. The numerator for each percent is the number of persons arrested for a charge during the 5-year follow-up period, and the denominator is the number released for each type of commitment offense. Detail may not sum to total because a person may be arrested more than once and each arrest may involve more than one charge. When information on the arrest charge was missing in the criminal history records, the court disposition data were used to describe the charge. See appendix table 11 for standard errors.",,,,,,,,,,,
